# Gym

Major Reinforcement Algorithms are implemented and benchmarked.
Code is modular and simplistic, can be easily tinkered around
to change characteristics of environment, model and hyperparameters.

Following algorithms are implemented:
* Deep-Q network (Implemented)
* Reinforce (Implemented)
* Deep deterministic policy gradient (In progress)
* Actor-Critic (In progress)

A detailed description of algorithm can be found in respective directories

## Bechmarks
Will be updated soon.
